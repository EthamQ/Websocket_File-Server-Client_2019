# Websocket_File-Server-Client_2019

Just a simple client - server test application.
On the client side I used React for the first time just to check it out.
The client requests an image from the server (requests a file by name) via Websocket and if it exists on the server he displays it.
The server uses Netty and Java and sends the requested file as binary if it exists.
